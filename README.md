## Temperature effect on different aspects of a diode

I did this series of scripts to se the variation of different aspects of a diode with the temperature.

Basically graph the equation used in any PN-junction to see the changes with the temperature.

Sorry it is in spanish and is just scripting, I will updated and will define some functions to use it just adding some specification of the diode.
